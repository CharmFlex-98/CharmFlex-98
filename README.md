## Hi ðŸ‘‹
Coming from an engineering background with proficient Korean speaking skills, I am currently a software developer focusing on Android development. I enjoy programming so much that I constantly engage in my own hobby projects during my free time. I consider myself independent, a team player, result-oriented, determined, and a strong learner.

Currently I am learning backend technologies in my free time and continuing sharpen my skills on android/mobile frontend development. Learning new things keeps me excited, and I believe it will be an endless journey full of excitement.
